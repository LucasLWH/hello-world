Trying out GitHub! :)
I'm excited to be trying out programming! It basically permeates our lives now, and I want to be able to build something useful myself! I think that idea is pretty cool, to be sort of given the ability to create something from nothing...although I'm far from any of that wizardry myself. Still, I'm happy to be venturing out a bit more than just my academic texts on Python Programming to see what I can truly do with programming. Hoping to complete some cool projects here
